      <h1><span>About</span> Hotel KM</h1>
      <p>Hotel KM was founded by Aaditya Singh in 2009 when he purchased the KM House motel adjacent to the Tribhuwan International Airport. Over the following decade, Aaditya Singh and his sister, Arya, working together with other Singh family business interests, grew the company into a Nepali management and hotel ownership company, which became a public company in 2012. </p> <p> In 2015, KM International was formed and subsequently became a separate public company. KM Corporation and KM International Corporation were taken private by the Singh family business interests in 2017 and 2018, respectively. On December 31, 2019, substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by Singh family business interests, including KM Corporation and KM International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity, now KM Hotels Corporation.</p>

      <p>From the moment we entered the KM, we were given an exceptional welcome.  From the receptionist to the spa, to the restaurants, the staff is discrete and efficient. We were especially impressed with the efforts that the waiters and manager of the restaurant to ensure our comfort.  The views were gorgeous.</p>
